# Introduction
Morgen API allows developers to build features that interact with calendars hosted on different providers, including Google, Microsoft, Apple and other CalDAV providers.

## What can I do?
**Morgen API** allows you to:
- Integrate any of our supported calendars into your software. Learn more here: [Morgen API Reference](/introduction).
- Develop [Custom Workflows](/custom-workflows) that interact with calendars and **run on our infrastructure** without you having to deploy anything.



## Get Your API Key
To use the Morgen API, you need to get an API key. You can get one by signing up at [https://platform.morgen.so](https://platform.morgen.so).
