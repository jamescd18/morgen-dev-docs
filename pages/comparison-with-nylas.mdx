# Comparison with Nylas

Morgen APIs work differently than Nylas APIs in many ways.
If you are familiar with Nylas, you may find it helpful to compare Morgen APIs with Nylas APIs.


## End Users
Nylas does not have the concept of end user. When an end user is redirected
to Nylas to connect their account, they are redirected to a page where they
can select which account they want to connect. Nylas then connects to that
account and returns an access token to you (the application). 
The application can then use that access token to operate on the connected account on behalf of
the end user. This means that you need to store the access token(s) for each user account in the your database,
associating those tokens with your internal User ID.


**Morgen associates each authenticated account to a User ID.** You will not receive
an access token for each connected account. Instead, you only need the
User ID, your Client ID and your Client Secret to generate a JWT token that
allows you (the application) to list the accounts an end user has connected, 
and to operate on those accounts on behalf of the end user.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **The User ID is provided by you (the application).** Most likely, you want
  to use your internal User ID to avoid having to maintein a mapping between
    your internal User ID and the Morgen User ID.

## No Sync Policy
Nylas requires an application to specify a sync policy, indicating how many days of data history Nylas will sync. Only events
within the specified sync policy will be returned by the Nylas APIs.

**Morgen does not have a sync policy.** In fact, Morgen does not sync calendar events at all.
When you list the events for a connected account, you _must_ specify 
time range to retrieve events for. Events will be retrieved on the fly from the
calendar provider, map the events to the Morgen event model, and return the
events to you.
