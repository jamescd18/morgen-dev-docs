# Accounts

As an API gateway, the Morgen Sync service needs to be able to access the accounts of the users of the
services it aggregates. This is done by using OAuth2.0 in most cases. The Morgen Sync service is registered
as an application with the services it aggregates. To operate on a third-party account (e.g. create an event via
Google Calendar), the user must first grant the Morgen Sync service access to the account. This is done by the
user being redirected to the third-party service's login page. After logging in, the user is redirected back to
the Morgen Sync service. The Morgen Sync service then has access to the account and can operate on it.

## Supported services
The Morgen Sync service currently supports the following services:

### Calendars
* Google Calendar / Google Workspace
* Office 365
* Microsoft Exchange
* Outlook.com
* CalDAV (including iCloud, Nextcloud, ownCloud, etc.)

### Contacts
* Google Contacts / Google Workspace
* Office 365

## Videoconferencing
* Google Meet / Google Workspace
* Microsoft Teams
* Zoom

## How to connect an account

To initiate the authorization process on behalf of a user, you can use the following endpoint:

```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://gateway.morgen.so/integrations/:providerId/oauth/authorize \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer JWT_USER_TOKEN'
```

The `providerId` is the ID of the provider you want to connect an account for. The `JWT_USER_TOKEN` is the
JWT token of the user you want to connect an account for (see [Authentication](/sync-authentication)).
